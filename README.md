# pimatic-android-hybrid-app

Simple Android app to display the pimatic frontend inside Android.
This is not a native app!

Should work from 4.2+ up.

# ToDo

- [x] Better way of navigating to config (not two title bars in one app) swiping? Edit: Fixed by double tap
- [x] Improve Error Handling (SSL etc.) Edit: Added toggling option to config // show ssl error if occurs
- [x] add option to toggle fullscreen ([#2](https://github.com/georg90/pimatic-android-hybrid-app/issues/2)) Edit: Added toggle to config
- [x] Option to change resolution ([#1](https://github.com/georg90/pimatic-android-hybrid-app/issues/1)) Edit: Value between 0 (default) and 800%
- [ ] Improve caching?
- [ ] Native app

# Source Code

I'm not an Android developer you'll see when you take a look at the source code ;-) 
I use Eclipse with ADT - just import the "sources" folder into Eclipse.
