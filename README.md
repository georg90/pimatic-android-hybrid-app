# pimatic-android-hybrid-app

Simple Android app to display the pimatic frontend inside Android.
This is not a native app!

Should work from 4.2+ up.

# ToDo

- [x] Better way of navigating to config (not two title bars in one app) swiping? Edit: Fixed by double tap
- [x] Improve Error Handling (SSL etc.) Edit: Added toggling option to config // show ssl error if occurs
- [ ] add option to toggle fullscreen
- [ ] Option to change resolution
- [ ] Improve caching?
- [ ] Native app

# Source Code

I'm not an Android developer you'll see when you take a look at the source code ;-) 
I use Eclipse with ADT - just import the "sources" folder into Eclipse.
